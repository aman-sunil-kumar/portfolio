**Data Scientist (Intern) @ Sapience Technology LLC**

- Developed predictive models in Python using Scikit-learn and Pandas to forecast customer behavior and optimize feature recommendations, leading to a 15% increase in user engagement and driving data-driven product enhancements.
- Collected & refined requirements from stakeholders into functional design to build, implement, & deploy BI solutions.
- Conceptualized data warehousing models using ER Diagrams to model data from 10+ sources, including Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, into orders and shipping facts and dimensions for improved reporting and decision-making.

### Projects

**Predictive Credit Scoring Model for Loan Repayment Risk Assessment**
- Developed a machine learning-based credit scoring model to predict loan repayment likelihood, leveraging logistic regression for classifying borrowers into "good" and "bad" credit risks, enhancing decision-making across loan approval, pricing, and refinancing processes.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including outlier treatment through flooring and capping, and missing value imputation (central tendency and class mean substitution), ensuring data quality and robustness for model building.
- Utilized Weight of Evidence (WOE) transformation for categorical variable substitution, and Information Value (IV) analysis to select strong predictors, improving model interpretability and predictive power.
- Engineered scorecards by scaling logistic regression coefficients, creating a scoring system that intuitively represents the risk levels of borrowers, used by financial institutions for credit decisioning and portfolio risk management.
- Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F-score), ensuring the final model delivered reliable predictions that aligned with business objectives in loan portfolios.
